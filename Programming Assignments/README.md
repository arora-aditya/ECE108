# Programming Assignments

### LAB1: Hello World
Introduction to testing suite Jenkins as well as the concept of a Makefile

### LAB2: Set Implementation
Implementation of a Set class with Tuple sub-elements
```C++
Set union_(const Set& s) const;          // Note _ because "union" is a C++ keyword
Set intersection(const Set& s) const;
Set difference(const Set& s) const;
Set select(predicate* p) const;          // Need to specify predicates
Set operator()(const int item) const;
Set project(const int numItems, const int items[]) const;
Set cartesian(const Set& s) const;
```

### LAB3: SAT Solver
Boolean Satisfiability solver to check whether a given `cnf` file was a Tautology, Satisfiable or Unsatisfiable ~~with shitty test-cases~~

### LAB4: Probabilities:
Implement random number generator to verify probabilities, alongside with implementing BlackJack (and counting cards :wink:)

### LAB5: Critical Path Management (Bonus Lab)
Critical Path Management Ã  la ECE190 style. (Worth as much as the other labs i.e. worth the work)
