\begin{solution}{1}
\item[]
    $$\textbf{Proof for: }{n \choose 0} + {n \choose 1} + ... + {n \choose n} = 2^n\textbf{  Proof (1)}$$

    For basic step n=0:
    $\binom{0}{0}=\frac{0!}{0!0!}=2^0$

    For induction step:
    Let k be an integer such that $0 < {k}$ and for all L, $0\le{L}\le{k}$ where $L\in{I}$, the formula stand true.
    Then let the following statement be trueh:
    $$\binom{k}{0}+\binom{k}{1}+...+\binom{k}{k}=2^k$$
    Now as can be illustrated easily $\binom{k}{0}=\binom{k+1}{0}$ and $\binom{k}{k}=\binom{k+1}{k+1}$.
    Now by using Pascal's identity,
    $$
        \binom{k+1}{0}+\binom{k+1}{1}+\binom{k+1}{2}+...+\binom{k+1}{k}+\binom{k+1}{k+1}\\$$ $$
        =\binom{k+1}{0}+\binom{k}{0}+\binom{k}{1}+\binom{k}{1}+\binom{k}{2}+...+\binom{k}{k-1}+\binom{k}{k}+\binom{k+1}{k+1}\\ $$ $$
        =\binom{k}{0}+\binom{k}{0}+\binom{k}{1}+\binom{k}{1}+\binom{k}{2}+...+\binom{k}{k-1}+\binom{k}{k}+\binom{k}{k}\\ $$ $$
        =2*{\sum_{i=0}^k\binom{k}{i}}\\=2*2^k\\=2^{k+1}
    $$
    As the formula is also true for $k+1$ hence by second principle of finite induction this formula is valid for all integers greater than or equal to $0$.\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \parskip=0in
    \parsep=0in
    \itemsep=0.1in
    \item Let $E$ be the event such that you get all six numbers at least once. $E'$ is the event such that you never get all 6 numbers. Since $E$ and $E'$ are complimentary events we can safely say that $$P(E) + P(E') = 1$$ where $P(x)$ is the probability of an event $x$ occurring.

    Number of time $E'$ occurs = Total number of cases($6^n$) - Number of time $E$ occurs\\
    We now need to find out the number of times $E'$ occurs. It can be such that:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Roman*)]
    \parskip=0in
    \parsep=0in
    \itemsep=0.1in
    \item Only one number occurs $n$ total times:\\
        There are only 6 such cases where only one of the numbers occurs
    \item Only two numbers occur $n$ total times:\\
        Out of the 6 numbers on a dice we can select two of them to show up, we can then permute their arrangements.\\
        So we first select 2 out of the 6 numbers: $\Co{6}{2}$.\\
        Then we need to find the number of their permutations which works out to $2^n$ because for each roll we basically have to choose between the 2 numbers.\\
        Therefore the total number of cases is $\Co{6}{2} 2^n$
    \item Only three numbers occur $n$ total times:\\
        Similar to when we have two numbers: We first select 3 out of the 6 numbers $\Co{6}{3}$ and then permute them $3^n$ ways which works out to $\Co{6}{3} 3^n$ total cases
    \item Only four numbers occur $n$ times: \\
        Similar to when we have two numbers: We first select 4 out of the 6 numbers $\Co{6}{4}$ and then permute them $4^n$ ways which works out to $\Co{6}{4} 4^n$ total cases
    \item Only five numbers occur $n$ times:\\
        Similar to when we have two numbers: We first select 5 out of the 6 numbers $\Co{6}{5}$ and then permute them $4^n$ ways which works out to $\Co{6}{5} 5^n$ total cases
    \end{enumerate}
        Adding all these cases up we get the total number of time $E'$ can occur as: $6+\Co{6}{2} 2^n+\Co{6}{3} 3^n+\Co{6}{4} 4^n+\Co{6}{5} 5^n$\\
        $$ 15*2^n + 15*2^{2n} + 20*3^n + 6*5^n + 6 $$
    The total number of cases = $6^n$
    Thus the total number of occurrences possible of $E$ are \\$6^n - {(15*2^n + 15*2^{2n} + 20*3^n + 6*5^n + 6)}$\\
    Thus $$P(E) = \frac{6^n - {(15*2^n + 15*2^{2n} + 20*3^n + 6*5^n + 6)}}{6^n}$$
    \item We know that $n=2i \Rightarrow i = n/2$, half of the positions are filled with $1's$ and $2's$ while the rest are filled with $3's,\ 4's,\ 5's$ and $6's$\\
    So for $1's$ and $2's$: There are $n/2$ places out of the $n$ places possible that are filled with $1's$ and $2's$.\\
    So for filling those $i$ places:\\
    We can select $r$ places out of the $i$ places to fill with $1's$ and the rest with $2's$. We can then change $r$ from $0$ to $i$ to account for all possible combinations of $1's$ and $2's$\\
    $$\sum_{r=0}^{i} \Co{i}{r} = 2^i\ \ \ \ \ \ \  \text{           [Using Proof(1)]}$$
    Therefore we now know that for having $1's$ and $2's$ in $i=n/2$ places the possible combinations are $=2^{i}$
    For filling out the remaining places with $3's,\ 4's,\ 5's$ and $6's$\\
    Let $j$ places out of the remaining $i$ places be filled with $3's$, $k$ out of the remaining $i-j$ places be filled with $\ 4's,$ and lastly $l$ out of the remaining $i-j-k$ be filled with $\ 5's$. All the remaining $i-j-k-l$ places can be filled with $\ 6's$\\
    We can then change $l$ from $0$ to $k$, $k$ from $0$ to $j$ and $j$ from $0$ to $i$ to account for all possible combinations of $3's,\ 4's,\ 5's$ and $6's$\\
    $$\sum_{j=0}^{i} \sum_{k=0}^{j} \sum_{l=0}^{k} \Co{i}{j}  \Co{i-j}{k} \Co{i-j-k}{l}$$
    $$\sum_{j=0}^{i} \sum_{k=0}^{j} \sum_{l=0}^{k} \Co{i}{j}  \Co{i-j}{k} \Co{i-j-k}{l}$$
    $$= \sum_{j=0}^{i} \sum_{k=0}^{j} \Co{i}{j}  \Co{i-j}{k}\ 2^{i-j-k}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \text{                   [Using Proof(1)]}$$\\
    Now using Binomial Theorem twice $( (1+x)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}  x^k ) ]$
    $$= \sum_{j=0}^{i} \Co{i}{j}\ 3^{i-j}$$
    $$=4^{i}$$
    Therefore we now know that for having $3's,\ 4's,\ 5's$ and $6's$ in $i=n/2$ places the possible combinations are $=4^{i}$  \\
    Now we just have to select $n/2$ places out of the given $n$ places and fill those with $1's$ and $2's$, the remaining $n/2$ places can be filled automatically with $3's,\ 4's,\ 5's$ and $6's$.\\
    Therefore for arranging the $1's$ and $2's$ we have $\Co{n}{\frac{n}{2}} 2^{\frac{n}{2}}$ combinations. But for each such case there are $4^i$ arrangements of $3's,\ 4's,\ 5's$ and $6's$\\
    Therefore the total number of combinations is: $\Co{n}{n/2} 2^{\frac{n}{2}} 4^{\frac{n}{2}}$ which on simplification yields: $\Co{n}{\frac{n}{2}} 2^{\frac{3n}{2}}$

     $$P(E) = \frac{\Co{n}{\frac{n}{2}} 2^{\frac{3n}{2}}}{6^n}$$

    \item We know that $n=3i \Rightarrow i = n/3$, one third of the positions are filled with $1's$ and $2's$, another one third of the positions are filled with $3's,\ 4's$ while the rest are filled with $5's$ and $6's$\\
    So for $1's$ and $2's$: There are $n/3$ places out of the $n$ places possible that are filled with $1's$ and $2's$.\\
    So for filling those $i$ places:\\
    We can select $r$ places out of the $i$ places to fill with $1's$ and the rest with $2's$. We can then change $r$ from $0$ to $i$ to account for all possible combinations of $1's$ and $2's$\\
    $$\sum_{r=0}^{i} \Co{i}{r} = 2^i\ \ \ \ \ \ \  \text{           [Using Proof(1)]}$$
    Therefore we now know that for having $1's$ and $2's$ in $i=n/3$ places the possible combinations are $=2^{i}$
    Similarly for arranging $3's,\ 4's$ in $i$ positions we get $2^{i}$ arrangements. Similarly for $5's$ and $6's$ we get $2^{i}$ arrangements.\\

    Now we just have to select $n/3$ places out of the given $n$ places and fill those with $1's$ and $2's$, another $n/3$ places can be filled automatically with $3's,\ 4's$ the remaining positions can be filled $\ 5's$ and $6's$.\\
    Therefore for arranging the $1's$ and $2's$ we have $\Co{n}{\frac{n}{3}} 2^{\frac{n}{3}}$ combinations. But for each such case there are $2^i$ arrangements of $3's,\ 4's$ and another $2^{\frac{n}{3}}$ $5's$ and $6's$\\
    This means we have to select another $n/3$ positions to fill with $3's,\ 4's$, the rest can be then filled with $5's$ and $6's$. This leads to: $\Co{n}{n/3} \Co{2n/3}{n/3} 2^{\frac{n}{3}} 2^{\frac{n}{3}} 2^{\frac{n}{3}}$\\
    Therefore the total number of combinations is: $\Co{n}{n/3} \Co{2n/3}{n/3} 2^{\frac{n}{3}} 2^{\frac{n}{3}} 2^{\frac{n}{3}}$ which on simplification yields: $\Co{n}{n/3} \Co{2n/3}{n/3} 2^{n}$ $$P(E) =\frac{n!*2^n}{(i!)^3 * 6^n}$$
    \item Let $E$ be the event such that you get all \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ occurs at least twice. $E'$ is the event such that you \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ doesn't occur at least twice. Since $E$ and $E'$ are complimentary events we can safely say that $$P(E) + P(E') = 1$$ where $P(x)$ is the probability of an event $x$ occurring.

    Number of time $E'$ occurs = Total number of cases($6^n$) - Number of time $E$ occurs\\
    We now need to find out the number of times $E'$ occurs. It can be such that:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Roman*)]
    \parskip=0in
    \parsep=0in
    \itemsep=0.1in
    \item \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ occurs only once:\\
        Out of the $n$ rolls if \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ occurs only once then there are only $\Co{n}{1} = n$ such selections but each such selection has $5^{n-1}$ choices for the remaining dice rolls
        Therefore total selections: $n5^{n-1}$
        % from the $n$ rolls where \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ occurs only once.
    \item \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ never occurs:\\
        If \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ never occurs then we can say that each of the $n$ rolls can either be $2$ or $3$ or $4$ or $5$ or $6$. This means that each roll has 5 options which means that total such cases are $5^n$
    \end{enumerate}
    Thus the total number of cases for $E$ are $6^n - E'$, which means total cases for E are: $6^n - 5^n - (n5^{n-1})$
    $$P(E) = \frac{6^n - 5^n - (n5^{n-1})}{6^n}$$

    \item Let $E$ be the event such that you get all \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ occurs at least k times. $E'$ is the event such that you \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ doesn't occur at least k times. Since $E$ and $E'$ are complimentary events we can safely say that $$P(E) + P(E') = 1$$ where $P(x)$ is the probability of an event $x$ occurring.

    Number of time $E'$ occurs = Total number of cases($6^n$) - Number of time $E$ occurs\\
    We now need to find out the number of times $E'$ occurs. It can be such that:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \parskip=0in
    \parsep=0in
    \itemsep=0.1in
    \item \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ occurs only $k-1$ times: \\
    Select $k-1$ positions and fill them with ones, the rest positions can be filled with any number from $2$ to $5$. Thus total such cases come out to be:\\
        $\Co{n}{k-1} * 5^{n-k+1}$
    \item \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ occurs only $k-2$ times:\\
    Select $k-2$ positions and fill them with ones, the rest positions can be filled with any number from $2$ to $5$. Thus total such cases come out to be:\\
        $\Co{n}{k-2} * 5^{n-k}$
    \item $\dotsb$
    \item[(k)] \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ occurs only once:\\
        Out of the $n$ rolls if \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ occurs only once then there are only $\Co{n}{1} = n$ such selections but each such selection has $5^{n-1}$ choices for the remaining dice rolls
        Therefore total selections: $n5^{n-1}$
        % from the $n$ rolls where \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ occurs only once.
    \item[(k+1)] \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ never occurs:\\
        If \textquotedblleft1\textquotedblright \ never occurs then we can say that each of the $n$ rolls can either be $2$ or $3$ or $4$ or $5$ or $6$. This means that each roll has 5 options which means that total such cases are $5^n$
    \end{enumerate}
    The total cases for $E'$ are $\sum_{r=0}^{k-1} \Co{n}{r} * 5^{n-r}$ \\
    Thus the total number of cases for $E$ are $6^n - E'$, which means total cases for E are: $6^n - \sum_{r=0}^{k-1} \Co{n}{r} * 5^{n-r}$
    $$P(E) = \frac{6^n - \sum_{r=0}^{k-1} \Co{n}{r} * 5^{n-r}}{6^n}$$

    \item
    % You have a communications system that transmits bundles of data from a source to a destination. Most bundles are received correctly. However, there is a random chance of the data in a bundle being in error. Roughly every $E^{th}$ bundle is in error. If you transmit $n$ bundles, what is the probability of at least two bundles being in error? What is the probability of at least $k$ bundles being in error?\\\\


    % Probability that a bundle is in error $= 1/E$ and probability that it does not error is $= (E-1)/E$. Let $R$ be the event such that you get at least 2 bundles are in error $= 1/E$ and the probability for \\$R'$ is $=1- (1/E) = (E-1)/E$. $R'$ is the event such that you less than two bundles are in error. Since $R$ and $R'$ are complimentary events we can safely say that $$P(R) + P(R') = 1$$ where $P(x)$ is the probability of an event $x$ occurring.

    % Number of time $R'$ occurs = Total number of cases($2^N$) - Number of time $R$ occurs\\
    % We now need to find out the number of times $R'$ occurs. It can be such that:
    % \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Roman*)]
    % \parskip=0in
    % \parsep=0in
    % \itemsep=0.1in
    % \item Only $k-1$ errors:\\
    %     Out of the $n$ bundles if only $k$ error-ed then we select $k$ out of the $n$ which we can consider to be the error bundles. The probability of that occurring is
    % \item Only one bundles errors:\\
    %     Out of the $n$ transmitted bundles if only one bundle error-ed then it could be any one of the $n$ bundles. Therefore total such cases $=\Co{n}{1} = n$. Therefore the probability of this occuring is $= (\frac{E-1}{E})^{^{n-1}}$ since all but one bundle did not error
    % \item No bundle errors:\\
    %     There is only one case where no bundle errors and the probability of that occurring is $= (\frac{E-1}{E})^{^{n}}$ because none of the bundle error-ed.
    % \end{enumerate}
    % Therefore the probability of event $E'$ is $= (\frac{E-1}{E})^{^{n-1}} + (\frac{E-1}{E})^{^{n}}$ which implies that the probability of $E$ is $1 - P(E) = 1 - (\frac{E-1}{E})^{^{n-1}} + (\frac{E-1}{E})^{^{n}}$
    % \\\\
    % Thus, the total number of occurences $P(E) * \text{Total events} (2^n) = (1 - (\frac{E-1}{E})^{^{n-1}} + (\frac{E-1}{E})^{^{n}}) * 2^n$
    Let’s say the bundle is like a $E$-sided dice, if we roll a $E$, we get error

    \parskip=0in

    \item Total size when there are zero errors:  $\Co{n}{0} (E - 1)^n$ \item Total size when there is exactly one errors:  $\Co{n}{1} (E - 1)^{n-1}$
    \item Total size when there are exactly 2 errors:  $\Co{n}{2} (E - 1)^{n-2}$
    \item $\dotsb$
    \item[(k)] Total size when there are exactly k-1 errors:  $\Co{n}{k-1} (E - D1)^{n-k+1 }$
    \end{enumerate}
    Probability for at least 2 errors: $$\frac{E^n - \sum^{1}_{r=0}\Co{n}{i}(E-1)^{n-i}}{E^n}$$

\begin{problem}{2}
Prove (using induction) the binomial theorem:
\[
(x+a)^n = \sum_{r=0}^n{^{n}C_{r}}\ x^{n-r}a^r
\]
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}{2}
\item[]
$$\binom{n}{r} = {^{n}C_{r}}$$
Pascal's Law: $\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n-1}{r}+\binom{n-1}{r-1}$, where $n$ and $r$ are each $\ge 1$. Expressing the right-hand side in terms of factorials, we get
$$\frac{(n-1)!}{r!(n-r-1)!}+\frac{(n-1)!}{(r-1)!(n-r)!}.$$
We want to bring the above expression to a common denominator. So we multiply top and bottom of the first term by $n-r$, and top and bottom of the second term by $r$. We get
$$\frac{(n-1)!(n-r)+(n-1)!r}{k!(n-r)!}.$$
The bottom now looks nice. The two terms on top have a common factor of $(n-1)!$. So the numerator can be rewritten as
$$(n-1)![(n-r)+r)],$$
which is $(n-1)!n$, that is, $n!$. Thus we end up with $\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, which is $\binom{n}{r}$.

Thus \textbf{Pascal's Law} is true: $\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n-1}{r}+\binom{n-1}{r-1}$\\
Now for proving the Binomial Theorem
\[
P(y) = (x+a)^y = \sum_{r=0}^y{^{y}C_{r}}\ x^{y-r}a^r\]
We will first see if $P(1)$ is true
\[
P(1) = (x+a)^1 = x^1 + a^1 = \sum_{r=0}^1{^{1}C_{r}}\ x^{1-r}a^r
\]
Thus we can see that $P(1)$ is True

Let us assume that $P(m)$ is true. This means that
\[P(m)  = (x+a)^m = \sum_{r=0}^m{^{m}C_{r}}\ x^{m-r}a^r
\]
Now using $P(m)$ we will try to prove $P(m+1)$\\
We know $P(m) * (x+a) = P(m+1)$\\
Thus: \[P(m+1) = {\sum_{r=0}^m{^{m}C_{r}}\ x^{m-r}a^r } * (x+a) \]
\[\Rightarrow P(m+1) = {\sum_{r=0}^m{^{m}C_{r}}\ x^{m+1-r}a^r } + {\sum_{r=0}^m{^{m}C_{r}}\ x^{m-r}a^{r+1} } \]
\[\Rightarrow P(m+1) = {\sum_{r=0}^m{^{m}C_{r}}\ x^{m+1-r}a^r } + {\sum_{r=1}^m{^{m}C_{r-1}}\ x^{m+1-r}a^{r} } \]
\[\Rightarrow P(m+1) = {{^{m}C_{0}}\ x^{m+1}a^0}+  {\sum_{r=1}^m{^{m}C_{r}}\ x^{m+1-r}a^r } + {\sum_{r=1}^m{^{m}C_{r-1}}\ x^{m+1-r}a^{r} }\]
$$[\text{Re-indexing the sum}]$$
\[\Rightarrow P(m+1) = {{^{m+1}C_{0}}\ x^{m+1}a^0}+  {\sum_{r=1}^m({^{m}C_{r}}\ x^{m+1-r}a^r + {^{m}C_{r-1}}\ x^{m+1-r}a^{r}}) \]
$$[{^{m}C_{0}} = {^{m+1}C_{0}} = 1]$$
\[\Rightarrow P(m+1) = {{^{m+1}C_{0}}\ x^{m+1}a^0}+  {\sum_{r=1}^m({^{m}C_{r}}+ {^{m}C_{r-1}})\ x^{m+1-r}a^r} \]
\[\Rightarrow P(m+1) = {{^{m+1}C_{0}}\ x^{m+1}a^0}+  {\sum_{r=1}^m{^{m+1}C_{r}}\ x^{m+1-r}a^r} \]
$$[\textbf{Pascal's Law: }{^{m}C_{r-1}} + {^{m}C_{r}} = {^{m+1}C_{r}}]$$
\[\Rightarrow P(m+1) = {\sum_{r=0}^m{^{m+1}C_{r}}\ x^{m+1-r}a^r} \]
$$[Re-indexing\ the\ sum]$$\\

Thus we have shown that if $P(m)$ is true we can show that $P(m+1)$ is True. \\

Thus we can say that using the principal of mathematical induction that $
(x+a)^n = \sum_{r=0}^n{^{n}C_{r}}\ x^{n-r}a^r
$ is True

\begin{problem}{3}
Is there
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \parskip=0in
    \parsep=0in
    \itemsep=0.1in
    \item a graph with 5 vertices and 3 edges?
    \item a graph with 5 odd-degree vertices with 3 edges?
    \item a connected graph with 5 vertices and 3 edges?
    \item a directed graph with 5 vertices and 3 edges?
    \item a disconnected graph (a graph that is not connected) with 5
vertices and 7 edges?
    \item a disconnected, directed graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges?
    \item a graph with 3 vertices and 5 edges?
    \item a directed graph with 3 vertices and 5 edges?
\end{enumerate}

In each case, if there exists such a graph, illustrate it; if not, explain (precisely) why not.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}{3}
\item[]
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Yes there is a graph with 5 vertices and 3 edges \\ \includegraphics[width=4cm]{graph1}
\item No there does not exist a graph with 5 odd-degree vertices because the sum of all degrees is always even (because the sum of all the degrees is equal to twice the number of edges), but with 5 odd-degree vertices the sum would be odd.
\item No there does not exist a connected graph with 5 vertices and 3 edges because every connected graph with v vertices needs to have at least v - 1 edges
\item Shown below is a graph that is a directed graph with 5 vertices and 3 edges \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Directed graph with 5 vertices and 3 edges}
    \includegraphics[width=4cm]{graph7}
\end{figure}
\item \pagebreak
No there does not exist a dis-connected graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges. If we try to use 4 connected vertices and 1 disconnected vertex, we only end up with 6 edges\\
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Graph with 4 connected vertices}
    \includegraphics[width=4cm]{graph2}
\end{figure}
If we use 2 connected components, one with 3 connected vertices and one with 2 connected vertices. We still end up with 4 edges\\
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Graph with 2 connected components}

If we move to 3 connected components we get only 2 edges

    \item Yes the graph is connected since every pair of vertices are connected

    \item The maximum degree of the graph is 7
    \item The largest clique is of size 4 namely $V10, V11, V13, V16$

    \item The shortest path is of length 4 and is $V1 \rightarrow V4 \rightarrow V9 \rightarrow V{14}
